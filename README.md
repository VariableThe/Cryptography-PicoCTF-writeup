# Overview
### Hello, these are all problems from [picoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/practice?page=1&search=) suggested by [MIST](https://wearemist.in/). This project was done while I was travelling and the network connection was horrible, so I had a lot of problems with cloning
### repositories and other online tasks, but somehow I pulled through, all in all, I wasted a lot of time on this chasing wromg leads, bug fixing and whatnot, Infact over 70 percent of the time I spent on these 5 was about everything except the actual CTF. But in the end, 
### I've pulled through. All in all, it was a fun experience.
